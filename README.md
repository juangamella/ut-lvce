# UT-LVCE: Perturbations and Causality in Gaussian Latent Variable Models

This repository contains a Python implementation of the UT-LVCE algorithms from the 2022 [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06950) "Perturbations and Causality in Gaussian Latent Variable Models", by A. Taeb, JL. Gamella, C. Heinze-Deml and P. BÃ¼hlmann. It is also available as the python package `utlvce`.

You can find the full docs at https://utlvce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.
